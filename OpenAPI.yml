      company user accounts. These APIs empower administrators to add, update,
      and edit user profiles for internal company users. Additionally,
      individual users have the ability to modify their own profiles, change
      passwords, and manage user permissions and permission groups.


      **Key Features of Account APIs:**


      1. **User Management:**
          
          - Add, update, and edit user profiles for internal company users using the Account APIs.
              
          - Ensure accurate and up-to-date information for all users within the APTRS system.
              
      2. **Self-Service Profile Modification:**
          
          - Empower individual users to edit their own profiles, providing a self-service option for maintaining personal information.
              
      3. **Password Management:**
          
          - Allow users to change their passwords through dedicated API endpoints, enhancing security and user control.
              
      4. **User Permission Control:**
          
          - Manage user permissions for each API of APTRS, controlling access for individual users.
              
          - Utilize permission groups to efficiently assign and manage access control based on specific user roles.
              
      5. **Granular Access Control:**
          
          - Implement granular access control for each user, ensuring precise control over the functionalities and features accessible to different users.
              

      These APIs offer a comprehensive solution for internal company user
      account management, providing administrators and individual users with the
      tools needed to maintain accurate profiles, enhance security through
